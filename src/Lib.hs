-- my second attempt - adding Maybe a to support error return, but...
-- divideSafe :: (Show a, Eq a, Fractional a) => a -> a -> Maybe a
-- divideSafe x y = Just $ x / y


-- changing result to Maybe a, but something wrong?
-- divideSafe :: (Eq a, Fractional a) => a -> a -> Maybe a
-- divideSafe x y = Just $ x / y
-- divideSafe _ 0 = Nothing

-- getting there
-- divideSafe :: (Eq a, Fractional a) => a -> a -> Maybe a
-- divideSafe _ 0 = Nothing
-- divideSafe x y = Just $ x / y

-- elaboration
-- TODO: i need to fix this seriously.
