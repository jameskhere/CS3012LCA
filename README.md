# CS3012LCA
This is attempt 3 at the CS3012 Project for CS3012 (the previous repositories have been removed). After several failed attempts at tackling the problem using Rust, I decided to switch language and instead build the project using Haskell. 

NOTE: The main function does nothing, but in order to run the executable version, the correct stack command to use is 
```
stack exec CS3012-P01-exe
```
as I am using the Haskell project template provided by Stephen Barrett for CS3012.
