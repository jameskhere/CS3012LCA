# CS3012LCA
This is attempt 3 at the CS3012 Project for CS3012 (the previous repositories have been removed). After several failed attempts at tackling the problem using Rust, I decided to switch language and instead build the project using Haskell. I am using the Haskell project template provided by Stephen Barrett for CS3012.

This branch includes an implementation of a Directed Acyclic Graph. As the first section was implemented as a Binary Search Tree rather than a Binary Tree, this branch reworks the graph system almost entirely.
